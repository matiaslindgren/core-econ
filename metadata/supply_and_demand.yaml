title: Supply and demand
desc:
  - Three different firms producing goods at three different efficiency levels.
  - All firms are price-takers and must therefore choose the number of units produced such that the marginal cost is equal to the market price of the produced unit.
  - It is assumed there are no taxes and the demand is constant.

    <span class="equations">Each firm has a cost function <span class="kx">\text{C}(Q)</span>, where <span class="kx">Q</span> denotes number of produced units.</span>
